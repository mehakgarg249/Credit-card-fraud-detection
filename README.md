ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction feature analysis and a trained classification model.
The app provides a Streamlit-based web interface where users can input transaction data and instantly get fraud predictions.

ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project aims to identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions by analyzing anonymized transaction features (V1â€“V28) and additional engineered features such as Hours and AvgRatio_of_Amount.

It leverages a trained machine learning pipeline (saved in .joblib format) that has been preprocessed and optimized for fraud detection.
ðŸš€ Features

Interactive Streamlit App for easy prediction

Pretrained ML model (via Joblib) for instant inference

Custom feature input fields for real transaction simulation

Clear output with fraud/legit classification message

ðŸ§© Technologies Used

Python 3.10+

Streamlit

Pandas

NumPy

Joblib

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ§® How It Works

The user inputs selected transaction features such as:

V4, V8, V12, V14, V17

Hours

AvgRatio_of_Amount

The system fills in default values for all other hidden features (V1â€“V28) using precomputed averages.

The feature vector is passed into the trained model.

The model predicts:

âœ… Legitimate Transaction

ðŸš¨ Fraudulent Transaction

ðŸ“Š Model Training

The model was developed and trained in pipeline_model.ipynb, which includes:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature scaling and transformation

Model selection and evaluation

Saving the final model using joblib

ðŸ§  Future Enhancements

Integrate real-time API for live transaction data

Add visual analytics dashboard for transaction trends

Deploy app on Streamlit Cloud / AWS / Render
